##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I used the documentation provided in the lab notes and the pre-work readings to decide which html elements would apply to which css file (to the best of my ability).

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I have not (yet) simply so I could get this lab done. I would like to go back and practice refactoring so I can get better at CSS.
